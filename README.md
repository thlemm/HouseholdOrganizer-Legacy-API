This is the REST API written in PHP that belongs to the [household-catalog-app](https://github.com/thlemm/household-catalog-app).

It was built upon this MIT-licensed [Rest API Example](https://github.com/spoehner/rest-api-example) by [Stefan PÃ¶hner](https://github.com/spoehner). The License information for this can be found inside LICENSE.EXAMPLE.MIT.

I expanded this basic REST API to serve all the features I implemented in my [household-catalog-app](https://github.com/thlemm/household-catalog-app).
